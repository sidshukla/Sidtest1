Following are the assumptions made while developing the applications:

1. The input CSV file and XML file are valid as per the required format. No validation is performed on the same.

2. The information in the CSV file is valid i.e. the product information matches the XML file data.

3. For the number of batches ordered , we have assumed that  if you sold n of a certain product where n is a multiple of the batchsize,
   then you have ordered exact multiple and not more
   
4. For calculating the probability at the same time , we have assumed that all the transactions with the same transaction id is ordered by
   same customer at the same time.
